# awesome-critical-tech-reading-list
A opinionated reading list for the critical programmer. Books and articles on the topics of Politics, Society and Ethics. A list curated by programmers for programmers.

This repository collects interesting books and articles useful to understand the political, social and ethical discourse about the recent development in the IT and Tech sectors and how this is important to create a more fair, just, sustainable future. Programmers and tech people in general often pose themselves as passive in the discourse due to the general lack of interest in these topics, scarcity of time to dedicate to non-technical readings and complicated inter-disciplinary communication with Philosophers, Journalists and Artists that dominate the discourse inside and outside the Academia. 

The goal of this list is to give a track to follow to get up to speed, understand the implications of tech in modern society and be able to participate in the debate, so that engineers won't take a passive role anymore but instead develop their own discourse, a step necessary to go beyond the reductionist, simplified views that in the past years prevented us to take a relevant role in shaping our present. 

### Basics

* [Post-capitalism: A Guide to our future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostCapitalism:_A_Guide_to_Our_Future): a short reflection on how the information economy has changed the rules of labour and market, how Tech might shape them in the future and how new technologies and new modes of production enable us to achieve critical medium/long term goals.

* [Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a world without work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventing_the_Future:_Postcapitalism_and_a_World_Without_Work): this book outlines a practical strategy to act upon the current problems of our society and places engineers and makers in a pivotal position to shape a better idea of future. A reading necessary to understand why political involvement of tech people is decisive and how they are greatly empowered by the new economical and political conjuncture.

* [Notes from Below: Technology and the Worker](https://notesfrombelow.org/article/technology-and-the-worker): this list of articles details different aspects of being a worker in Tech nowadays, what is going on politically and socially in American big tech companies and how Tech workers are beginning to organize themselves. This bridges the concepts introduced by the first two books with what is likely your daily experience of working in a company.

## AI

AI is probably the most contested field in the last few years, where many actors are trying to dictate the narrative, either for ideological reasons, economical interests or both. The Academia and the Engineers are lagging behind but recently more and more content is being produced to counter the established narrative. 

AI, in this context, means a fuzzily-defined set of technologies that include machine-learning, at-scale data gathering and analytics, modern industrial automation, chatbots, autonomous vehicles and drones control systems and occasionally other technologies.

### AI and Ethics
* [The Mythos of model interpretability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf)
### AI and Politics
* [Manufacturing an Artificial Intelligence Revolution](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3078224)

## Labor

* [Coding is not ‘fun’, it’s technically and ethically complex](https://aeon.co/ideas/coding-is-not-fun-it-s-technically-and-ethically-complex): why the "coding is fun" narrative is dangerous and insulting to students and engineers.
