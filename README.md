# awesome-critical-tech-reading-list
An opinionated reading list for the critical programmer. Books and articles about the intersection of Technology with politics, society and ethics. A list curated by programmers for programmers.

This repository collects interesting books and articles useful to understand political, social and ethical discourses about new technological developments. Understanding this connection is necessary to create a fair and sustainable future. The discourse affects programmers and tech people that become passive actors. This is due to their general lack of interest in these topics, scarcity of time to dedicate to non-technical readings and the existence of barriers preventing inter-disciplinary communication with philosophers, journalists and artists. 

The goal of this list is to give a track to follow to get up to speed, understand the implications of tech in modern society and be able to participate in the debate, so that engineers can inform themselves in order to develop their own discourse. This is step necessary to go beyond the reductionist, simplified views that in the past years prevented us to take a relevant role in shaping our present. 


## AI

AI is probably the most contested field in the last few years, where many actors are trying to dictate the narrative, either for ideological reasons, economical interests or both. The Academia and the Engineers are lagging behind but recently more and more content is being produced to counter the established narrative. 

AI, in this context, means a fuzzily-defined set of technologies that include machine-learning, at-scale data gathering and analytics, modern industrial automation, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, drones control systems and other technologies.

## Labor

* [Coding is not ‘fun’, it’s technically and ethically complex](https://aeon.co/ideas/coding-is-not-fun-it-s-technically-and-ethically-complex): why the "coding is fun" narrative is dangerous and insulting to students and engineers.
* [The Agile Labor Union](http://www.metareader.org/post/agile-labor-union.html): how Agile development methodology empowered IT workers and protected them over the years and how alternatives are threatening workers' autonomy.


## Meta
* [Resisting reduction](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/resisting-reduction): using the religion around Singularity, the author presents in a concise way what does it mean to deal with complex systems and why naive, reductionists views should be rejected when presented as solutions to social problems.

## What is going on around you and what role do you play in it?

* [Post-capitalism: A Guide to our future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostCapitalism:_A_Guide_to_Our_Future): a short reflection on how the information economy has changed the rules of labor and market, how Tech might shape them in the future and how new technologies and how changing how programmers work will help us achieve critical medium/long term goals.

* [Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a world without work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventing_the_Future:_Postcapitalism_and_a_World_Without_Work): this book outlines a practical strategy to act upon the current problems of our society and places engineers and makers in a pivotal position to shape a better idea of future. The book explains how tech people are greatly empowered by the new economic and political conjunction to shape the future.

* [Notes from Below: Technology and the Worker](https://notesfrombelow.org/article/technology-and-the-worker): this journal details different aspects of being a worker in Tech nowadays, reporting real life examples on what is going on politically and socially in American big tech companies, and how Tech workers are beginning to organize themselves.
